    the top level and can contain further compound types or simple
    types, nested within.

    For lists, the corresponding items in 'b' are appended.  This will

    recursively.  Other types are merged according to the above rules.

    For simple types (integers, strings, etc.), the value in 'b'
    replaces the value in 'a'.

    type (list, set or dictionary) then a TypeError() exception is

    replace -- this indicates whether a simple type in 'a' should be
    replaced by a value in 'b'; this effectively determines whether
    values in 'a' or 'b' have precedence

    list_as_set -- this specifies whether lists should be treated as
    lists (= False), resulting in [potentially] duplicated items, or as
    sets (= True), which will only add items from 'b' if they don't
    already exist in 'a' (although note that it won't filter out
    duplicates already in 'a')

    change_types -- this specifies whether a value of one simple type
    can replace that of a different (simple) type (for example, a
    string replacing an integer)

def deepdiff(a, b, list_as_set=False, change_types=False, filter_func=None):
    """Recursively compare two nested compound objects - 'a' and 'b' -
    returning what needs to be done to transform 'a' into 'b'.  Both
    'a' and 'b' must be compound types (a list, set or dictionary) at
    the top level and can contain further compound types or simple
    types, nested within.

    The return value is a 2-tuple: ('remove_items', 'update_items'):

    'remove_items' is what needs to be removed from 'a' (i.e. items
    that are in 'a' that are not in 'b').

    'update_items' is what (then) needs to be added or modified to 'a'
    (i.e. items that are in 'b' that are not in 'a', or items where the
    value in 'b' is different from 'a').

    Calling 'deepremoveitems(a, remove_items)' followed by
    'deepmerge(a, update_items)' should result in 'a' being equal to
    'b' by value.  See those functions for more information.

    Note, however, the items to be removed/updated are not copied
    before being returned so will be the same object from 'a' or 'b'.
    This may cause trouble if they're modified or passed directly to
    deepremoveitems() or deepmerge() as it will break the interation
    process, as the same object will be iterated over twice,
    simultaneously.  To do this, they shoould be copy.deepcopy()ed
    first (or similar).

    The behaviour of this function depends on the type of object being
    compared (which must be the same for 'a' and 'b'):

    For lists, if they differ (at all - either in terms of order or the
    actual items) all items in 'a' are removed and all the items in 'b'
    updated (i.e. 'added'), effectively replacing the entire list,
    unless list_as_set is set to True, in which case they are handled
    as per a set (although the result will still be a list).  No
    attempt is made to transform the list, leaving the common items in
    place, as this would be tricky regarding the ordering.

    For sets, the items in 'a' that are not in 'b' are removed, and the
    items in 'b' that are not in 'a' are updated (added).

    For dictionaries, the process is more complicated: keys in 'a' that
    are not in 'b' are removed; keys in 'b' that are not in 'a' are
    updated (added).  Where a key exists in both, if the value is a
    compound type, a recursive call is made.  If the value is a simple
    type, it is updated (replaced), as long as it is of the same type
    (according to type()) - a TypeError is raised otherwise - unless
    change_types is set to True.

    Keyword arguments:

    a -- the 'from' object

    b -- the 'to' object

    list_as_set -- this specifies whether lists should be treated as
    lists (= False), resulting in [potentially] duplicated items, or as
    sets (= True), which will ignore the order of the list (although
    note that it won't filter out duplicates already in 'a' and leaves
    the type as a list).

    change_types -- this specifies whether a value can be changed from
    one simple type to another (for example, a string replacing an
    integer); if this is False and a difference is encountered, a
    TypeError will be raised.  This will not change between compound
    types (for example a list changing to a set).

    filter_func -- if this is specified, it is a function which is
    called upon each recursion, receiving the parameters (path [a
    DeepPath object], a, b) and returns a boolean specifying whether to
    act on this level or skip it: it can be used to filter at specific
    levels, perform some other action or raise an exception, if a
    particular level is problematic
